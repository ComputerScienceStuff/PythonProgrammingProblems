01 - Getting Started


The purpose of this problem is to get you started.  It just contains the basics: read a text file and write a text file.

All of the contest programs need to write a text file.  The judging software reads the text files to judge an answer right or wrong.  The filename must contain the problem number and your team name name, like 01-TeamName.txt.

The answer file should contain only the answer.  Don't submit the programs you used, just submit the answer.  

Most problems also require reading an input text file, and doing something with that input.  The input file is named Input-01.txt for problem 1.


Input:
For problem 1, the input consists of a single integer.

Output:
Write a program that says 'hello' n times on separate lines, where "n" is the number in the input file.

Don't put in any quotes or capital letter, just the word hello on each line. The judging software is case sensitive, just so you know.

Write your answers in a file named 01-TeamName.txt, one answer per line.



Example:
3


Answer:
hello
hello
hello
