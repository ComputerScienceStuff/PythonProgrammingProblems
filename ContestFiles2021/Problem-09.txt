09 - Capitalization Graph

Input:
The input consists of a word from the dictionary.  
Random letters in the word are capitalized.

Output:
Output is a table with two columns. 
The first column is the range of possible caps in a word. The range is fixed at 0 to 15.
The second column shows how many words with that number of caps appears in the word list.

So, once per line, print out an incremental range of 0 to 15, then a space, finally followed by one asterisk for each word in the list that has that number of capitals letters.

Right align the numbers so the graph lines up (add a leading blank to single digits of 0 to 9).

Example:
In the example list below:
zero caps occur 1 time 
one cap occurs 4 times (so range 1 has 4 asterisks) 
two caps occur 1 time 
three caps appear 1 time 
All the other counts occur 0 times.
