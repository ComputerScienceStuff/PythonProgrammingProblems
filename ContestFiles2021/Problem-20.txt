20 - Caesar Cypher

A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher in which each letter of the input text string is substituted with a letter found by moving n places down the alphabet. 
Spaces and punctuation should not be affected, and you should retain capitalization if you were to decipher the text. 

For example, assume the input text is the following:
abcd, xyz.
If the shift value is 4, then the encrypted text would be the following:
efgh, BCD

Note the shifted characters "wrap around", so z, shifted by 4, would be D, the fourth letter in the capitalized alphabet if we concatenated uppercase and lowercase 
letters into a single character array, like so:
ABCD...XYZabcd...xyz

Input:
The input consists of the integer shift value, a colon, and then the string (the intervening colon is not included as part of the string to transform).

Output:
Shift the input text string by the integer shift value.
Output one line for each input line with:
1) The line number starting with 0
2) A space seperator
3) The result of the shifted text.
