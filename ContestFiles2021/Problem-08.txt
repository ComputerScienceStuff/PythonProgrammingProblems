08 - Indexed Capitalization

Input:
The input consists of a word from the dictionary.  
Random letters in the word are capitalized.

Output:
Make sure one specific letter is capitalized.  
All the other letters stay as is (retain original case as read in from input file).

The letter to capitalize is determined by the first letter in the word.
If the first letter is "A" or "a", capitalize the first letter.
If the first letter is "B" or "b", capitalize the second letter.
If the first letter is "E" or "e", capitalize the fifth letter.
....
If the first letter is "Z" or "z", capitalize the twenty-sixth letter.

Follow the same pattern for all the letters in the alphabet.

If the word is too short for the index, don't change anything.
