18 - Convert time to interior angle

The interior angle of a clock is the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand.
On the clock face, at noon the interior angle is 0 degrees.  
At 3:00, the hour hand points at the 3 and the minute hand at 12, the interior angle is 90 degrees.  
At 6:00, the interior angle is 180 degrees .

Input:
Input is a time of day.  
AM or PM is irrelevant.
The input format is HH:MM:SS on a single line, between 12:00:00 and 11:59:59 inclusive.

Output:
Output is the interior angle between the minute hand and the hour hand.
Output will be the interior angle of the input time rounded to the nearest degree.
If the fractional portion is exactly one half, like 13.5, round it down to 13.
Each angle for each input time will be printed on a single line.
