Preliminary:
1) All of the contest programs need to read input data from a text file and write output to a text file.  
2) The judging software reads the output text file(s) to judge an answer right or wrong.  

Input Syntax:
1) Most problems require reading an input text file, and doing something with that input.  
2) The input file will named Input-01.txt for problem 1, Input-02.txt for problem 2 and so on.

Output Syntax:
1) The output filename must contain the problem number and your team name name. 
	For example, for team "Prometheous", the output filename for the first problem would be named:  01-Prometheous .txt.
2) The output file should contain only the answer.  Don't submit the programs you used, just submit the answer.  
3) Don't put in any extra quotes or capital letters.  The judging software is case sensitive, just so you know.
