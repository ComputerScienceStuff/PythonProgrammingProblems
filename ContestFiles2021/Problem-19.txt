19 - Symmetrical Numbers

A symmetrical number is the same as its reverse (it is the same number if read from right to left as it is if read from left to right).
Single digits (or no digits) are not symmetrical. 
Lines with non-numeric data are not symmetrical.

Input:
For this problem, the input consists of a line of text. 

Output:
Determine if that text represents a symmetrical number.
Output one line for each input number with:
1) The line number starting with 0
2) A space seperator
3) The result of the symmetry validation test (true, if it is symmetrical, false if not).
Again, remember case sensitivity.
