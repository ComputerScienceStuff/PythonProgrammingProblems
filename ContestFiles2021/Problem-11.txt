11 - More Votes

Input:
The input consists of a line of digits, 1 or 0, with a space in between each.
There may be 1 to 9 digits on each line.  
For each input line, read in each digit in the line and determine if the line is a Pass or a Fail.
The digit 1 means Pass and 0 means Fail.
A majority of pass votes are required for a line to pass.  
All ties fail, only majorities pass.

Output:
Output is a single word per line, Pass or Fail.  
Write Pass if the line has a majority of pass votes, write Fail if not.
Once per line, write out Pass or Fail.  
Make sure the P or F is capitalized and the rest of the letters in the word are lowercase.
