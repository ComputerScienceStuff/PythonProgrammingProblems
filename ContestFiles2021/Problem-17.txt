17 - Convert Clock Angles to Time

The interior angle of a clock is the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand.
On the clock face, at noon the interior angle is 0 degrees.  
At 3:00, the hour hand points at the 3 and the minute hand at 12, the interior angle is 90 degrees.  
At 6:00, the interior angle is 180 degrees .
Don't forget that the hour hand advances slightly as the minute hand moves around the face of the clock.
The minute hand also advances slightly as the second hand moves.
The interior angle would be the angle difference between the hour hand and the minute hand in degrees.
Angle of Minute Hand = (MM  + ss/60) * 6 degrees (each minute is 1/60th of 360 degrees)
Angle of Hour Hand = (hh +  (MM/60 + ss/3600)) * 30 degrees (each hour is 1/12 of 360 degrees)
The 12 represents the 0 th hour for these calculations.

Input:
The input is an interior angle of the minute and hour hand in degrees.
Input is an integer between 0 and 180 inclusive. 

Output:
The output is all the possible times from interior angle.  
Don't worry about AM and PM.
There are multiple possible times for each angle.  
For instance, an input of 0 degrees will result in times of 12:00:00, 02:10:54, 09:49:05, etc.

Output begins with input angle followed by a space and the word "Degrees".  
	The judging software is case sensitive, just so you know.
Next output each time in HH:MM:SS format, one per line.
When the time for a particular angle occurs falls between seconds, omit the fractional portion of the second.  
For instance, 10:54:32.727 should be printed as 10:54:32.
The times should be sorted from the earliest time to the latest time. 
We consider 12:00:00 as the earliest time and 11:59:59 as the latest time.
Each time should be output on a single line.

Write your answers in a file named 17-TeamName.txt, one time per line.
